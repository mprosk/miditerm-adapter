# MidiTerm USB Adapter
MIDI UART to USB adapter designed for use with the [`miditerm`](https://github.com/mprosk/miditerm) application.

This is simply the MIDI electrical interface connected to an FTDI UART to USB Serial IC. It allows you to connect to MIDI devices as a USB serial port rather than as a class compliant USB MIDI device, allowing for lower level access to the individual data bytes.

I had a broken Yamaha Model UX16 USB-MIDI Interface cable lying around so I decided to design the board to fit into the enclosure within that cable. It opens easily and has the cables nicely exposed so it was super easy to hack into. Thanks Yamaha
